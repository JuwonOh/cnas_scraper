  "content": "This report aims to provide guiding principles and concrete policy suggestions for how to make realistic progress in preventing Iran from building a nuclear weapon and countering its destabilizing behavior under the assumption that the United States does not return to the JCPOA and that it continues its current pressure campaign. The recommendations in this report seek to take advantage of U.S. strengths, but also recognize the limits of U.S. influence and, in some cases, political will. We offer suggestions for where the United States should seek near-term “wins” and where it can accept short-term “draws” while it pursues longer-term efforts to change Iranian policies. This is an approach that ultimately tries to perpetuate Iran’s compliance with the nuclear commitments in the JCPOA even as economic pressure increases. And it is an approach that more effectively pushes back against Iran’s activities in the Middle East without either dramatically increasing U.S. involvement or pulling back from the region.\nAlthough this is an Iran strategy, it also identifies where U.S. Iran policy intersects with other critical national security priorities such as counterproliferation, maintaining the efficacy of sanctions, and counter-terrorism—and makes recommendations for how to navigate potential contradictions in U.S. policy.\nWe recommend the following 12 actions:\nClarify through words and action that the U.S. administration’s strategy is not regime change but a “big for big” trade and reinforce the benefits to Iran of reaching a deal.Keep communications channels with Iran open while pursuing the goal of high-level talks.Foster an environment where Iran continues to adhere to the nuclear restrictions and transparency measures in the JCPOA.Develop a set of calibrated options to deter those Iranian nuclear activities that matter most and begin laying the groundwork for a realistic long-term solution to the Iranian nuclear challenge. Seek realistic limitations on Iran’s missile program and strengthen counter-proliferation efforts.Use sanctions policy, and other tools, to maximize pressure by highlighting Iran’s non-nuclear illicit activities. Mitigate the negative effects of unilateral U.S. sanctions toward Iran on the U.S. economy and preserve the foundation for effective sanctions on Iran over the long term.Work more closely with Arab partners to counter Iranian irregular warfare.In Syria, manage the withdrawal of U.S. forces in such a way that prioritizes preventing a reemergence of ISIS, but also tries to limit Iranian gains to the extent possible.Pursue a patient strategy in Lebanon to slowly undercut Hezbollah’s influence by building up viable alternatives.Demonstrate a clear, long-term commitment to Iraq.Offer the Saudis a clear choice in Yemen: greater U.S. involvement in exchange for a fundamental shift in how the war is conducted or an end to American support.\nDownload these recommendations\nRead the full report here.\n\nDownload PDF",
