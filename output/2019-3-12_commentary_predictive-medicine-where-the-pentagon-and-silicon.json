  "content": "With over 9.4 million patients in the Department of Defense (DoD) healthcare system and another 9 million patients enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system, the federal government has the largest healthcare system in the world. In the era of machine learning, this translates to the most comprehensive healthcare dataset in the world. The vastness of the DoD’s dataset combined with the department’s commitment to basic biological surveillance yields a unique opportunity to create the best artificial intelligence–driven healthcare system in the world. The goal of predictive medicine is urgent and achievable, and would have transformative effects throughout the medical profession.\nWhy should the DoD care? Talking cancer alone, $1.7 billion of the Defense Health Agency’s annual budget is spent on cancer, and that fraction is growing. Cancer requires the most expensive type of care, and the patient population continues to grow. The medical profession still does not know all the causes for the various types of cancer. From a readiness perspective, cancer is responsible for many medical separations, lost duty time (for those who can return to duty), and loss of livelihood and normalcy for dependents. Some patients requiring radiation and chemotherapy are not always lucky enough to survive the long process, and those that do have a potential for long term health complications. Moreover, diagnostic errors are the most common cause of malpractice, resulting in large Defense Health Agency (DHA) payouts.\n\nMore broadly, from 2001 to 2016, funding for central medical programs increased by 84 percent and is the single fastest growing cost of DoD support functions. The cost of providing that care has increased rapidly as a share of the defense budget over the past decade, out-pacing growth in the economy, growth in per capita health care spending in the United States, and growth in funding for DoD’s base budget. The United States is equally falling behind nations like China and Canada, where data sharing is easier, in artificial intelligence (AI) applications for healthcare.\n\nPredictive medicine can address force readiness challenges. Given all the data, not only can DHA physicians and researchers make more accurate predictions, they can discover relatively strong links between unknown baskets of variables. For example, there may be combinations of genomics and environmental exposures that make certain warfighters more vulnerable to injury or infections.",
