  "date": "February 13, 2019",
  "content": "This week, the U.S. government released two major new strategic documents on artificial intelligence. The White House published an executive order by President Trump launching the American AI Initiative, and the Department of Defense released a summary of the DoD AI Strategy. Experts from the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) weigh in on these developments.\nWhite House Executive Order on AI\nGregory C. Allen, Adjunct Senior Fellow: “This is an important act by the White House in that it formalizes AI as a national priority in the upcoming FY2020 budget request and directs federal agencies to submit plans for increasing the use of AI in executing their missions. Effective follow up and follow through will be critical to sustain the momentum generated by this executive order.”\n\nKara Frederick, Associate Fellow: “Monday’s executive order is slim on the details, but that’s okay. Its utility is as a signaling document that 1) identifies the engines of tech power projection where the United States should focus investment (workforce development, standard setting, etc.) and 2) nests the discussion within the great power contest where it belongs.”\n\nDr. Michael C. Horowitz, Adjunct Senior Fellow: “AI is a key future enabler of economic and military power. The Trump administration’s new executive order on AI makes clear that competing with China and others to sustain U.S. AI leadership is a priority. How new U.S. investments in AI and interagency coordination will actually occur is less clear. A key challenge will be balancing the desire by the U.S. government to set AI priorities with the need to foster America’s comparative advantage – a more free-market approach to innovation than America’s technological competitors.”",
